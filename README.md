# iMoBoard
Android app for calculating maneuvering board problems

## Purpose
iMoBoard is an easy-to-use maneuvering board application developed in 2010 for mobile Android devices that solves closest-point-of-approach (CPA) and contact course/speed problems. In addition, iMoboard implements an intuitive graphical interface consisting of a digital maneuvering board for displaying contact relative motion with respect to own ship at center, and a contact line-of-sight (LOS) display for displaying contact angle-on-the-bow.

## Features
• Space - Traditional maneuvering boards require a flat surface with which to work on. In addition, traditional maneuvering boards require an assortment of tools (such as plotters, dividers, triangles, and parallel rules). iMoBoard requires no external space or tools to work.

• Speed - Determining a contact's course, speed, and CPA using a traditional maneuvering board is a relatively time-consuming process. iMoBoard automatically calculates a contact's direction of relative motion (DRM), speed of relative motion (SRM), course, speed, and CPA when at least 2 range/bearing observations have been made, and no plotting is required.

• Clarity - Multiple contacts on a traditional maneuvering board can start to clutter the situational picture and possibly create confusion. iMoBoard displays only one contact on the graphical maneuvering board at a time, and contact selection can be changed quickly and easily with 2 taps of the display.

• Accuracy - Due to it's software nature, calculations by iMoBoard are more accurate than those obtained by using a traditional maneuvering board.

• Modifiable - If bearing and/or range information is mis-plotted on a traditional maneuvering board, the time-consuming process of re-plotting the correct data has to be started all over again. With iMoBoard, incorrect observation data can be quickly edited (even deleted), and solutions are automatically recalculated using the updated data.

• Persistence - iMoBoard stores all contact information in a database on your mobile device's storage system, and the data is persistent even across power cycles.

• Simplicity - Learning how to master a traditional maneuvering board to correctly and proficiently solve contact course, speed, and CPA problems requires a significant investment in time. iMoBoard eliminates this learning curve by reducing the effort of producing contact solutions to simple data entry tasks.

• Cost - A pad of maneuvering board sheets can be purchased for between $5 and $10. iMoBoard is significantly lower in cost and can be used for the life of your mobile device.
